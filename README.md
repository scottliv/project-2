## Built With
HTML SASS Javascript jQuery

## Personal Learning
This project taught me how to fetch data from an external source and process it. I learned JSON and AJAX, and how to access specific pieces of information in a json file. I learned SASS to improve my stylesheets, and initially used GULP as a task manager to output minified build files and use eslint to check my script file for errors and have since changed to webpack to learn task running with a different tool.
